## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was my first project using TypeScript, so I learned how to define and use type-specific variables. I look forward to working with TypeScript on larger projects in the future where its type safety and refactoring support would have a greater impact.

```js
const navLinks: string[] = ["Home", "About", "Contact", "Blog", "Careers"];
```

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This well-documented reference website helped me efficiently transition from vanilla CSS to Tailwind CSS. It is a popular CSS framework that promotes increased efficiency in styling applications.
- [Font Awesome Icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons) - This is pretty comprehensive library of classic and brand icons. It also offers various ways to add icons to your project, like via global import in React or copy/paste the svg tag.
